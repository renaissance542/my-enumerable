Recreate enumerable methods in Ruby using blocks, procs, and/or lambdas

Reflection:  This seemed like an easy assignment until I had to make sure the methods worked properly with optional arguments, blocks and/or procs, and no arguments.  In the end I had most of the functionality of the library methods, except for hashes.  I was looking for some generic iterator that would return elements in sequence for both hashes and arrays, but it looks like other solutions simply wrote separate code for both possibilities.  

I got good practice working with method parameters of all types, and working with blocks and procs.  I did not get any significant practice of pattern matching, which was part of the material leading up to this project. 

Note that the extensive options available in defining method parameters seem to replace overloaded methods that we used in Java.
